# SpaceJame

### I Made This: 
https://spacejamm.herokuapp.com/

### What is It?: 
Pinterest/Instagram blog using NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of The Day) API.

### Purpose: 
Post awesome photos directly from NASA. Educational, and simply beautiful.

### This is For: 
People of any age who enjoy astronomy, or just pretty pictures. 

### What It Has/What Was Used:
* JavaScript
* React
* Firebase as My Backend/Database
* CSS
* Third-Party API from NASA

### Issues I Ran Into:
* Had to learn Firebase.
* Had to create a JavaScript function breaking down the API links into strings, and ignoring any YouTube videos posted by NASA.
* Unable to auto-fill page easily with photos. More complicated than anticipated, has to be done manually at the moment.
* Time-management: Change of ideas, things taking longer than anticipated, etc.

### If I Had One More Day:
* Definitely make sure login information is set-up according. I started it, but was unable to finish simply due to time.

### If I Had Two Weeks vs. One Week:
* Complete MVP Would Be Done: All backend, log-in, all front-end, and would've set up auto-fill
